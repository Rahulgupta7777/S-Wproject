        Galaxies are vast and magnificent systems, spanning millions to trillions of stars, planetary systems, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter. Bound together by gravity, they are the universe's fundamental building blocks. These fascinating celestial structures have captivated humanity for centuries.
    </p>
    <h2>What Are Galaxies?</h2>

    <p>
        A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system consisting of stars, stellar remnants, gas, dust, and dark matter. They vary in size, ranging from dwarf galaxies with a few billion stars to giants containing a hundred trillion stars or more. Galaxies are classified into three primary types based on their shapes: spiral, elliptical, and irregular.
    </p>
    <h3>Spiral Galaxies</h3>

    <p>
        Spiral galaxies are perhaps the most visually stunning. They are characterized by a flat, rotating disk of stars and gas, often accompanied by a central bulge and spiral arms. Our galaxy, the Milky Way, is an excellent example of a spiral galaxy. These arms often host regions of active star formation, making them particularly vibrant.
    </p>
    <h3>Elliptical Galaxies</h3>
    <div class="video-container">

        </video>
    <p>
        Unlike spiral galaxies, elliptical galaxies are more spherical or oval in shape and lack the intricate structure of spiral arms. They are composed mainly of older stars and typically have minimal star-forming regions. These galaxies are often found in densely populated galaxy clusters.
    </p>
    <h3>Irregular Galaxies</h3>

        </video>
    <p>
        Irregular galaxies defy classification into spiral or elliptical forms. They have no distinct shape, often due to gravitational interactions with other galaxies. Despite their chaotic appearance, irregular galaxies can host significant star-forming regions.
    </p>
    <h2>The Milky Way Galaxy</h2>

    <p>
        The Milky Way, our home galaxy, is a spectacular spiral galaxy containing over 100 billion stars. It spans approximately 100,000 light-years across and includes our Solar System, located in one of its spiral arms known as the Orion Arm. At the center of the Milky Way lies a supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A*, with a mass equivalent to millions of Suns.
    </p>
    <h2>Galaxies Beyond the Milky Way</h2>

    <p>
        Beyond the Milky Way, countless galaxies populate the universe. Some of these are our cosmic neighbors, such as the Andromeda Galaxy, which is expected to collide with the Milky Way in about 4.5 billion years, forming a new galaxy. Others, like the far-flung quasars, are billions of light-years away and provide insights into the early universe.
    </p>
    <h2>Dark Matter and Galaxies</h2>

    <p>
        One of the most intriguing aspects of galaxies is their connection with dark matter. Observations suggest that visible matter accounts for only a small fraction of a galaxy's mass. The rest is attributed to dark matter, a mysterious substance that does not emit light or energy but exerts a gravitational influence on galaxies.
    </p>
    <h2>The Evolution of Galaxies</h2>

    <p>
        Galaxies evolve over billions of years through processes such as star formation, mergers, and interactions. Collisions between galaxies, while rare, can have dramatic effects, leading to the formation of new stars and sometimes entirely new galactic structures.
    </p>
    <h3>Star Formation</h3>

        </video>
    <p>
        Star formation occurs in regions of galaxies where gas clouds collapse under gravity. These regions, known as nebulae, are often illuminated by the young, hot stars they produce. The lifecycle of stars, from their birth to their eventual death, significantly shapes the dynamics of a galaxy.
    </p>
    <h3>Galaxy Mergers</h3>

        </video>
    <p>
        When galaxies collide, their stars generally do not collide due to the vast distances between them. However, the gravitational interactions can trigger bursts of star formation and reshape the galaxies into new forms. Mergers are a natural part of the life cycle of galaxies.

        Throughout history, galaxies have inspired awe and wonder. Ancient civilizations observed the Milky Way as a faint band of light across the night sky, often attributing it to myths and legends. Modern science has revealed the true nature of galaxies, advancing our understanding of the cosmos.
