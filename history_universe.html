    <h2>1. The Big Bang (13.8 Billion Years Ago)</h2>
    <img src="image copy.png" alt="Big Bang" width="800px">
    <p>
        Origin of the Universe: The universe began as a singularity, a point of infinite density and temperature. The Big Bang marked the rapid expansion of space-time. 
        Formation of Fundamental Forces: Within fractions of a second, the four fundamental forces (gravity, electromagnetism, and strong and weak nuclear forces) separated. 
        Elementary Particles: Quarks, electrons, and photons emerged as the universe cooled.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Formation of Atoms (380,000 Years After Big Bang)</h2>
    <img src="formation of atoms.png" alt="atoms" width="800px">
    <p>
        Recombination Era: Electrons combined with protons and nuclei to form neutral atoms, primarily hydrogen and helium. 
        Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB): The light emitted during this period still exists today and provides a snapshot of the early universe.
    </p>

    <h2>3. The Dark Ages (380,000 to 100 Million Years)</h2>
    <img src="dark ages.png" alt="Big Bang "width="800px">
    <p>
        The universe was filled with neutral hydrogen and dark matter but had no stars or galaxies. 
        Gradually, gravitational pull led to the formation of denser regions, precursors to stars.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Formation of Stars and Galaxies (100 Million Years to 1 Billion Years)</h2>
    <img src="formation of stars .png" alt="Big Bang" width="800px">
    <p>
        First Stars (Population III Stars): Massive, short-lived stars ignited, producing the first light and creating heavier elements via nuclear fusion. 
        Galaxy Formation: Over time, stars grouped together into galaxies, the largest structures in the universe.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Cosmic Evolution (1 Billion to 10 Billion Years)</h2>

    <p>
        Quasars and Black Holes: Some galaxies developed supermassive black holes at their centers, releasing enormous energy as quasars. 
        Galactic Clusters: Galaxies began to form clusters and superclusters due to gravitational interactions.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Birth of the Solar System (4.6 Billion Years Ago)</h2>
    <img src="birth of solar system.png" alt="Big Bang" width="800px">
    <p>
        Formation of the Sun: A cloud of gas and dust within the Milky Way collapsed to form the Sun, surrounded by a protoplanetary disk. 
        Earth and Planets: Planets, including Earth, formed from the remaining material.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Life on Earth (3.5 Billion Years Ago to Present)</h2>
    <img src="life on earth.png" alt="Big Bang" width="800px">
    <p>
        First Life: Microbial life began on Earth around 3.5 billion years ago. 
        Complex Life and Evolution: Over billions of years, life evolved into complex organisms, leading to the development of humans about 300,000 years ago.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Expansion and Dark Energy (Present Era)</h2>
    <img src="dark ages 2.png" alt="Big Bang" width="800px">
    <p>
        The universe continues to expand, accelerated by dark energy. 
        Structure Today: The observable universe contains billions of galaxies, stars, and planets.
